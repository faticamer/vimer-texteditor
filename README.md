## Purify Content

REMINDER: This functionality gets rid of every modification that's been done to a text. 

## Saving changes

Since this program does not use any packages, it is not possible to export to .docx to see changes outside the program. Consider checking [this](https://github.com/mokeyish/obsidian-enhancing-export) repository for implementing such feature. Make sure to clone this repository first. Reason for not having this functionality is intentional omit of JS packages and libraries.

## Disclaimer

There are many edge cases yet to cover for each functionality. The future commits will cover as many of them as possible. Pull requests for any change/modification are welcome!
